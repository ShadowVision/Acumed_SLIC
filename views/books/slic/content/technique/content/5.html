The SLIC Screw Stepped Drill is introduced 
<br/>
through the Soft Tissue Protector (80-0848) and over the 0.045&quot; Guide Wire down to the scaphoid and into the lunate, checking its position frequently under fluoroscopy. Continue advancing the Stepped Drill until the step of the Stepped Drill reaches the junction of the SL interval as viewed under fluoroscopy.

After the step of the Stepped Drill has reached the SL interval, count the number of grooves (behind the drill flutes) that are completely buried beneath the cortical rim of the scaphoid at the entry site. This is viewed on fluoroscopy and determines the maximum length SLIC Screw that can be inserted. 
<br/>
There are three grooves that correspond to the 22 mm, 25 mm, and 28 mm SLIC Screw lengths, with the leading groove corresponding to the 22 mm SLIC Screw (55-0011), the middle groove corresponding to the 25 mm SLIC Screw (55-0012) and the trailing groove corresponding to the 28 mm SLIC Screw (55-0013).

Tip:

<span class="body-copy">
 Do not over-drill the scaphoid portion of the drill into the lunate as this will reduce the SLIC Screw bone purchase in 
<br/>
the lunate.
