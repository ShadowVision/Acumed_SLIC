Based on the grooves in Step 5, choose the maximum length SLIC Screw that will fully seat beneath the cortical rim of the scaphoid. This will allow for easier SLIC Screw removal after biological healing. Load the chosen SLIC Screw onto the appropriate SLIC Screw Driver (80-1162, 
80-1163, or 80-1164) for that screw length, making sure the SLIC Screw Driver fully engages the distal portion of the screw. The distal portion of the screw should not rotate freely.
Hold the distal portion of the screw on the SLIC Screw Driver as it is placed over the 0.045&quot; Guide Wire and slide down into the Soft Tissue Protector Cannula.

 If the driver tip is not fully engaged in both sections of the screw, the screw will not insert properly.
