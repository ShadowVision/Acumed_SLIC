Screw removal is recommended at 6-9 months or after biological healing of soft tissue has occurred. After incising and dissecting down to the scaphoid per STEP 3, re-insert the 0.045&quot; Guide Wire through the screw. Insert the appropriately sized SLIC Screw Driver fully into the screw and back out the screw. Make sure you keep firm pressure on the SLIC Screw Driver during removal to ensure the SLIC Screw Driver is engaged in the distal portion of the screw.

<span class="body-copy">
Screw removal is recommended at 6-9 months or after biological healing of soft tissue has occurred. If the appropriately sized SLIC Screw Driver does not remove the SLIC Screw, choose the appropriate size SLIC Screw Easyout based on what screw size was used. Make sure the hex is clear and insert the SLIC Screw Easyout fully into the screw by turning one full rotation counter-clockwise and back out the screw. Make sure you keep firm pressure on the SLIC Screw Easyout during removal to ensure the SLIC Screw Easyout is engaged in the lunate portion of the screw. If the Easyout is spinning, tap it with a mallet to move it further into the hex of both the lunate and scaphoid portions.
