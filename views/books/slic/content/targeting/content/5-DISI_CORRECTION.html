            <p class="Basic-Paragraph bottom-margin"><span class="body-copy">If scapholunate reduction is necessary, place a 0.045&quot; K-wire into the waist of the scaphoid under fluoroscopy. This will be used as the second joystick <br/>to reduce the SL interval into its anatomical position. Placement of scaphoid joystick will be based on surgeon discretion as long as it will not be in the path of the SL fixation guide wire. It is often placed from distal to proximal to reduce a flexed scaphoid if needed. Use the supplied SL Targeting Guide Joystick Clip (80-1057) or a pair of Kocher&rsquo;s clamps to bring the joysticks together and hold anatomical reduction of the scaphoid and lunate. The scaphoid should be rotated back into normal rotation without excessive bending in the K-wire. </span>
